BirthdayReminders is distributed as source code only and, as such,
needs to be compiled before it can be used. Compilation requires the
OS X build tools, which are installed with the Xcode package available
free on your OS X installation CD or www.apple.com. If you have not
yet installed the OS X development tools, do so now.

This software is built and installed in the same manner generally
applicable to most GNU Build System projects. Compile the program by
running:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local && make

Then, install it by executing:

    sudo make install

See make(1) for more information.
